whatever i ask you just do that thing only , try to complete all possible variations before adding any new stack to the code 
make sure the whole code is in mern stack and responsive 
to make the code responsive use tailwind css 
make sure the code is clean and eay to understand and integrate to a new project
while making the code make sure when you tryto fix a bug you dont break the existing code and add a new technical error 
make sure the code is optimized for performance and security
